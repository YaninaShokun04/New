I got my peaches out in Georgia, (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California, (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah! (Bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah! (Yeah, that's it)

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
And I say, oh, (Ohh)
The way I breathe you in, (In)
It's the texture of your skin,
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby,

Never let you go, oh!
And I say, oh,
There's nothing like your touch,
It's the way you lift me up, yeah,
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time.

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia, (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California, (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah! (Bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah! (Yeah, that's it)
